Five years ago, I landed in London with wide eyes and a heart full of wanderlust. The plan was classic: experience the charm of London, use it as a springboard to explore Europe, and eventually make the big move to the United States. It was the quintessential "American Dream" with a British twist. This was partially fuelled by the allure of easy immigration policies and the promise of a land paved with opportunity. Then, the world turned upside down. The pandemic hit, borders slammed shut, and "eventually" morphed into "indefinitely."  But as I navigated lockdowns, discovered hidden gems in my neighborhood, and built a life in this vibrant city, something unexpected happened: my plans changed.

## London, My Unexpected Home

At first, London was meant to be a stepping stone. I envisioned myself exploring its historical landmarks, indulging in afternoon tea, and maybe even catching a glimpse of the Queen.  And while I did all that (well, except for the Queen sighting!), I also found myself drawn to the city's unique rhythm. I embraced the cozy pub culture, the diverse culinary scene, and the ease of hopping on a train to explore incredible destinations like Paris and Amsterdam.

But more than that, I found a sense of belonging in London's multicultural tapestry. As someone with roots in India, I felt a deep connection to the city's rich diversity and its celebration of different cultures.  This feeling, coupled with the ease of visiting my family in Delhi, solidified London's place in my heart.

## Across the Atlantic: A Fading Dream

My relationship with the US is complicated. It's the land of opportunity, of innovation, and of undeniable cultural influence. I've even experienced it firsthand, having visited multiple times and even completed an internship there. But beneath the shiny facade, I found a reality that increasingly clashed with my values.

What struck me most was the absence of a truly safe and accessible city life. Sure, vibrant metropolises like New York City and San Francisco exist, but they come at an exorbitant cost, both financially and in terms of quality of life. I recently also got into urbanist content like city-design which made me very strongly understand the differences in the accessibility of places I want to go to.

The drawbacks of American city life became glaringly apparent:

* Long commutes (that you have to drive): Time wasted in traffic instead of enjoying life.
* Limited activities: A lack of a diverse set of activities and events beyond hiking or camping.

Furthermore, the US immigration system felt like a constant weight on my shoulders.  Even with a skilled worker visa, I was acutely aware of my precarious position, always at the mercy of my employer with no easy path to independence or a change of career.  Getting laid off with the fear of "find a job within 60 days or leave" is too much for me to live life peacefully.

And let's not forget the Second Amendment. The gun violence epidemic and the expensive healthcare costs further solidified my growing disillusionment.  While these issues were always present, living in the UK allowed me to really question the American Dream and whether I truly wanted it.

## Taking Root: The ILR Journey

The decision to stay in the UK long-term solidified when I received my Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR). The process, while at times overwhelming, was ultimately straightforward.  I just needed to pass a test called "Life in the UK," which is a story for another time. Once that was done, I received a decision in 2-3 weeks (my employer applied for priority, your mileage may vary).

## Looking Ahead
For now, London is another home. It's where I feel safe, supported, and connected. While I haven't completely ruled out a move to the US someday, the urgency is gone. I'm embracing the present, exploring all that London has to offer, and building a future in this city that has so unexpectedly captured my heart.
