The holiday season is here, and what better way to celebrate than with cocktails, good company, and a little friendly chaos? This year, I’m hosting a Christmas-themed cocktail party, complete with festive drinks and a White Elephant gift exchange.  

For those unfamiliar, White Elephant is where the line between thoughtful gifts and hilarious chaos blurs delightfully. It’s the perfect way to keep things unpredictable and fun!  

But let’s talk cocktails because, honestly, what’s a holiday party without a killer drink menu? Here’s what I’ve crafted this time:

Every cocktail is guaranteed to keep the spirits bright, and yes, the menu is 100% vegetarian-friendly to complement the all-veg food spread.  

Cheers to the season of joy, surprises, and (let’s be honest) the best excuse to make fancy drinks. Here’s to good times ahead!
