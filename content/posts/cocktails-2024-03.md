Okay, buckle up, because I have a tale to tell.  I, someone who usually orders the simplest possible drink at a bar, recently decided to throw caution to the wind and host a cocktail party. Armed with a shaker, some questionable recipes, and a healthy dose of hope, I embarked on a journey of amateur mixology.

Here's the thing, it was actually...a hit?  Let's just say the results may have been more influenced by a steadily-increasing blood alcohol content than genuine cocktail mastery, but who am I to complain?

Here is the menu I designed and I bought stuff for all of these drinks!

So, have I unlocked a hidden talent as a master mixologist? Probably not. But did I have a lot of fun pretending? Absolutely. Cheers to that!
